Tic-Tac-Toe Game in CA robust, terminal-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project focuses on clean code structure, modular programming, and user-friendly interaction within a CLI (Command Line Interface) environment.📋 Table of ContentsFeaturesTechnical ImplementationHow to RunCode ArchitectureFuture Enhancements✨ FeaturesTwo-Player Gameplay: Interactive mode for two local players with custom name inputs.Input Mapping: Uses a simple 'a-i' character mapping system, making it intuitive for users to pick a spot without typing coordinates.Input Validation: Built-in logic to handle invalid keystrokes and prevent players from overwriting occupied squares.Win/Draw Detection: Automatically evaluates the board state after every turn to detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal victories.🛠️ Technical ImplementationThis project utilizes core C programming concepts:2D Arrays: The game board is managed using a $3 \times 3$ character array.Pointers: Used for efficient string handling of player names.Control Flow: Implements a game loop using while logic and a switch-case block for coordinate mapping.State Management: Tracks turns, move counts, and winning status to ensure the game terminates correctly.🕹️ How to RunPrerequisitesA C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).CompilationClone this repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-c.git
Navigate to the directory:Bashcd tic-tac-toe-c
Compile the source code:Bashgcc main.c -o tictactoe
ExecutionRun the compiled program:Bash./tictactoe
🏗️ Code ArchitectureThe source code is organized into three main segments to ensure readability and maintainability:Main Loop (main): Controls the high-level game flow, alternating turns until a winner is found or the board is full.Player Action (player): Captures user input and validates the move. It ensures that the board state remains consistent.Win Condition Logic (check): An algorithmic approach to verify if the last move resulted in a win.🚀 Future Enhancements[ ] AI Opponent: Implementation of the Minimax algorithm for a single-player mode.[ ] Colorized Output: Adding ANSI escape codes to highlight 'X' and 'O' in different colors.[ ] Scoreboard: A file-handling feature to save win/loss records permanently.
